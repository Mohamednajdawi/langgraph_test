    "query": "which is heavier am elephant or a car? ",
    "summary": "Building on our previous discussions about locations, here is a clear answer to your new question:\n\nAn elephant is generally heavier than a typical car. Adult elephants, such as the African bush elephant, can weigh between 4,000 to 7,000 kilograms (8,800 to 15,400 pounds), with some large males reaching even higher weights. For example, the Indian elephant can weigh up to about 5,400 kilograms (11,900 pounds). In contrast, the average car usually weighs between 1,000 to 2,000 kilograms (2,200 to 4,400 pounds), depending on the model and type. Even with the trend of increasing vehicle weights (autobesity), most cars remain significantly lighter than an adult elephant. Therefore, elephants are heavier than most cars.",
